# 🧠 AI Offline Chat ADV (V1.0)

**AI Offline Chat ADV** is a modern, fully autonomous, and offline implementation of the legendary **ELIZA**—the world’s first artificial intelligence therapist, originally created at MIT in 1966. Re-engineered from the ground up for the **M5Stack Cardputer**, this firmware uses advanced C++ optimizations, JIT-compiled Regular Expressions (RegEx), and hardware-level memory protection to run a pure NLP (Natural Language Processing) engine directly on the ESP32-S3 chip, without requiring Wi-Fi or cloud APIs.

> **Source Code Status:** This project is proprietary. The source code is private. 
> **Distribution:** Binary (`.bin`) only via the **Releases** tab.

## ⚠️ Expectations (Must Read Before Use)

**This is NOT ChatGPT.** Please understand what you are installing:
* **No Cloud, No Servers:** The AI runs 100% locally on the microcontroller's limited SRAM.
* **Not an Encyclopedia:** If you ask her *"What is the capital of France?"* or *"Write code for me"*, she will not answer. She has no external knowledge base.
* **The Rogerian Therapist:** ELIZA is a psychological simulation. She uses a technique called "active listening." Her purpose is to analyze your grammar, reflect your statements back as questions, and encourage you to talk about your feelings, relationships, and problems.
* **The Illusion of Understanding:** She doesn't "think" in neural weights; she processes language via complex linguistic rules. The magic happens when you engage with her as if she were a real listener.

## ⚡ Technical Highlights

* **True Offline NLP Engine:** Processes Natural Language offline using a custom C++ parsing core, bypassing the need for heavy LLM models.
* **JIT-Compiled Regex System:** Employs Just-In-Time compilation for over 30 complex psychological trigger rules. The engine dynamically scans input and instantly flushes memory to prevent Heap fragmentation.
* **Hardware-Level Stack Protection:** Embedded C++ `<regex>` engines are notoriously dangerous on microcontrollers. This firmware features a custom sanitizer that truncates infinite quantifiers (`.*`), physically preventing RTOS Stack Overflows during deep recursive sentence analysis.
* **Long-Term SD Memory:** ELIZA remembers. She saves your name, family members, specific objects you mention, and the overall "emotional tone" of your last session to the SD card. She will greet you contextually based on your past trauma or relationship discussions upon reboot.

## 🛠 Installation
### Method 1: M5Burner (Recommended)
1. Open **M5Burner**.
2. Search for `AI Offline Chat ADV` or `Zeloksa`.
3. Select version **V1.0**.
4. Burn to your M5Stack Cardputer.

### Method 2: Manual Flashing
1. Go to the **[Releases]** tab of this repository.
2. Download the **`merged.bin`** (full 4B flash dump) or the standard app bin.
3. Flash to your Cardputer using **M5Burner** (Local File) or **esptool**.

## 🕹 Controls
* **[ Full Keyboard ]**: Type your thoughts normally.
* **[ ENTER ]**: Send message to ELIZA.
* **[ DEL ]**: Backspace / Delete character.
* **[ ; / . ]**: Scroll chat history Up/Down (if the chat exceeds screen height).
* **[ ESC / \` ]**: Open System Menu (Start New Session / Wipe Memory).

---

## 📖 Operational Guide

### 🗣 Engaging with ELIZA
For the best experience, type in full English sentences. Use pronouns (`I`, `My`, `You`) and express states or emotions.
* **Bad Input:** *"apple"* or *"hello bot"*
* **Good Input:** *"I feel really anxious about my new job today."* or *"My mother never listens to me."*

### 💾 Persistent Memory (SD Card Required)
An SD Card must be inserted for the long-term memory to function. The system creates a tiny profile (`/eliza_v7.txt`) where it stores:
1.  **Named Entities:** Your name and specific objects you care about.
2.  **Emotional Context:** If your session focuses on grief (`TOPIC_GRIEF`), the UI will adapt (green text, lower tone frequency), and ELIZA will remember your state across power cycles.
3.  **Color-Coded History:** The chat history is saved along with its specific emotional color coding.

### 🧠 The JIT "Thinking" Indicator
When you submit a complex sentence, the ESP32-S3 must compile and test multiple Regex patterns. You will see an `ELIZA: ...` indicator. This is not a fake animation; it represents the actual CPU blocking time required for the NLP engine to calculate its response before rendering it via a typewriter effect.

### 🔄 System Reset
If you wish to erase your psychological profile and start fresh, press `ESC` to open the dialog, or simply type *"Memory Wipe"* in the chat. ELIZA will wipe the SD card and reset her context variables.
